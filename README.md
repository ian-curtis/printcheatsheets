# Printing RStudio Cheatsheets at GVSU

## Data
The `rstudiocheatsheets.pdf` file contains all 17 sheets as published by RStudio as of October 19, 2021. Each individual sheet can be found in the `sheets/` directory in the event that you only want a select few. 

Everything in this repository is under a [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/), the same terms as the original cheatsheets by [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). No changes were made to the sheets themselves other than combining the `.pdf` files into one.

### Creating Your Own Combined `.pdf`
I would recommend printing the full 17 sheets; you never know when you might need one! However, if you only want a select few of them, follow these instructions.

1. Download from this repo the cheatsheets you want.
2. Go to www.combinepdf.com and upload your files.
3. Organize the files into the order you want them in. **Note: If you are including the `{forcats}` sheet, I recommend making that go first for good pagination.**
4. Click Combine and continue.

## Printing the Sheets
Printing is super easy and (as of October 2021) only costs $5.50 for all 17. Follow these steps.

1. Be prepared to send your combined `.pdf` file to copycenter@gvsu.edu. 
2. Go to the [GVSU Copy Center](https://www.gvsu.edu/busfin/gvsu-laker-store-copy-center-45.htm), located in the basement of the Laker Store.
3. Tell them that you have a pdf and would like the pages to be bound in a flipbook format. You want the following attributes:
    * Printed on slightly thicker paper
    * Full color
    * Minimal border
    * Spiral binding (the one that looks like a spring)
    * A clear front cover
    * Black back cover
    * Landscape printing, flipping on the long edge
    
If you are only doing one printing, they may be able to print and bind it for you right there (with a roughly 5 minute wait). 

## Payment
Payment is due after printing has finished. Cash is accepted until October 30, 2021. Otherwise, debit and credit cards work.
